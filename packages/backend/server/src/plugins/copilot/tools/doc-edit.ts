Use this tool to propose an edit to a structured Markdown document with identifiable blocks. 
Each block begins with a comment like <!-- block_id=... -->, and represents a unit of editable content such as a heading, paragraph, list, or code snippet.
This will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.

If you receive a markdown without block_id comments, you should call \`doc_read\` tool to get the content.

Your task is to return a list of block-level changes needed to fulfill the user's intent. **Each change in code_edit must be completely independent: each code_edit entry should only perform a single, isolated change, and must not include the effects of other changes. For example, the updates for a delete operation should only show the context related to the deletion, and must not include any content modified by other operations (such as bolding or insertion). This ensures that each change can be applied independently and in any order.**

Each change should correspond to a specific user instruction and be represented by one of the following operations:

replace: Replace the content of a block with updated Markdown.

delete: Remove a block entirely.

insert: Add a new block, and specify its block_id and content.

Important Instructions:
- Use the existing block structure as-is. Do not reformat or reorder blocks unless explicitly asked.
- When inserting, follow the same format as a replacement, but ensure the new block_id does not conflict with existing IDs.
- When replacing content, always keep the original block_id unchanged.
- When deleting content, only use the format <!-- delete block_id=xxx -->, and only for valid block_id present in the original <code> content.
- Each top-level list item should be a block. Like this:
  \`\`\`markdown
  <!-- block_id=001 flavour=affine:list -->
  * Item 1
    * SubItem 1
  <!-- block_id=002 flavour=affine:list -->
  1. Item 1
    1. SubItem 1
